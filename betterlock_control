Package: betterlockscreen
Version: 4.4.0-4
Architecture: amd64
Section: x11
Priority: optional
Description: Most of i3lock wrapper-scripts out there take an image, add some
    effect(s) then lock with the modified image as locker-background. Overall
    experience doesn't feel natural given delay of 2-3 seconds.
    Who would like a delay of 2-3 seconds while locking screen?
    So Betterlockscreen was my attempt to solve this problem, as we dont need
    to change lockscreen background frequently this script caches images with
    effect so overall experience is simple and as fast as native i3lock.
Depends: i3lock-color (>= 2.13.3), bc, imagemagick, x11-utils
