Version: 2.13.5-9
Architecture: amd64
Section: x11
Priority: optional
Description: i3lock is a simple screen locker like slock. After starting it, you will see a white screen (you can configure the color/an image). You can return to your screen by entering your password.
    Many little improvements have been made to i3lock over time:
    i3lock forks, so you can combine it with an alias to suspend to RAM (run "i3lock && echo mem > /sys/power/state" to get a locked screen after waking up your computer from suspend to RAM).
    You can specify either a background color or an image (JPG or PNG), which will be displayed while your screen is locked. Note that i3lock is not an image manipulation software. If you need to resize the image to fill the screen, you can use something like ImageMagick combined wih xdpyinfo:
    convert image.jpg -resize $(xdpyinfo | grep dimensions | sed -r 's/^[^0-9]*([0-9]+x[0-9]+).*$/\1/') RGB:- | i3lock --raw $(xdpyinfo | grep dimensions | sed -r 's/^[^0-9]*([0-9]+x[0-9]+).*$/\1/'):rgb --image /dev/stdin
    You can specify whether i3lock should bell upon a wrong password.
    i3lock uses PAM and therefore is compatible with LDAP etc. On OpenBSD, i3lock uses the bsd_auth(3) framework.
